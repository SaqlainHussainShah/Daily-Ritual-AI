# Project Report: Daily Ritual AI - Personalized Wellness Recommendation System

## Engagement Summary

Build an AI-powered wellness recommendation system that provides personalized food and drink suggestions based on user location, weather conditions, and daily activities. The system leverages multiple external APIs and AWS Bedrock AI services to deliver contextually relevant recommendations that promote healthy lifestyle choices.

Main objectives are personalization, real-time data integration, and intelligent recommendation accuracy. The scope covers food and beverage recommendations tailored to user activities, local weather patterns, and geographical preferences.

Major challenge is integrating multiple external data sources (weather, food nutrition, location services) while maintaining low latency and high availability. Cost optimization for AI model usage and API calls is also a key consideration.

Regarding implementation, the system uses IP-based location detection, fetches real-time weather data, queries nutritional databases, and leverages AWS Bedrock's Claude AI model for intelligent recommendation generation. The FastAPI backend provides RESTful endpoints for seamless integration with frontend applications.

## Use Case Description

**Primary Use Case**: Personalized Wellness Recommendations

The Daily Ritual AI system provides intelligent food and drink recommendations based on:
- User's current location (detected via IP geolocation)
- Real-time weather conditions
- User's planned or current activity
- Local food preferences and availability
- Nutritional information and calorie content

**Target Users**: Health-conscious individuals, fitness enthusiasts, travelers, and anyone seeking personalized nutrition guidance.

## Challenges

- **API Rate Limits**: Multiple external API dependencies (OpenWeather, Edamam, IP geolocation) with potential rate limiting
- **AI Model Costs**: AWS Bedrock usage costs can scale with request volume
- **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring reliable location detection and weather data accuracy
- **Response Latency**: Coordinating multiple API calls while maintaining fast response times
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Handling API failures gracefully without breaking user experience

## Success Criterion (Technical)

- Location detection accuracy > 90% for IP-based geolocation
- Weather data freshness within 1 hour of current conditions
- AI recommendation relevance score > 85% based on user feedback
- API response time < 3 seconds for complete recommendation flow
- System availability > 99.5% uptime
- Successful integration with nutritional database for calorie information
- Scalable architecture supporting concurrent users

## Data Description

The system processes and integrates multiple data sources:

**Input Data**:
- User IP address for location detection
- User activity type (office work, gym, outdoor activities, etc.)
- Optional city override from user input

**External Data Sources**:
- **Weather Data**: Temperature, weather conditions from OpenWeatherMap API
- **Nutritional Data**: Food items, calorie information from Edamam Food Database API
- **Location Data**: City, country, coordinates from IP geolocation service
- **Local Context**: Regional food preferences and availability

**Output Data**:
- Personalized food/drink recommendations
- Nutritional information (calories)
- Nearby places to find recommended items
- AI-generated reasoning for recommendations

## Formulated / Implemented Solution

The AI-powered system replaces manual food selection processes with intelligent, context-aware recommendations. Instead of users spending time researching appropriate foods for their activities and conditions, the system provides instant, personalized suggestions within seconds.

This reduces decision fatigue, promotes healthier choices, and adapts to local preferences and weather conditions automatically.

## Overall Solution Architecture

### Solution Overview

The Daily Ritual AI system is built as a microservices architecture using FastAPI, with modular services for different functionalities and AWS Bedrock for AI-powered recommendations.
