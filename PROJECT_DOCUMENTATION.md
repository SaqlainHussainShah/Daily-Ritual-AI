# Project Report: Daily Ritual AI - Personalized Wellness Recommendation System

## Engagement Summary

Build an AI-powered wellness recommendation system that provides personalized daily ritual suggestions based on user mood, location, weather conditions, and activities. The system leverages AWS Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, multiple external APIs, and AgentCore integration to deliver contextually relevant recommendations that promote healthy lifestyle choices and daily wellness routines.

Main objectives are personalization, real-time contextual awareness, intelligent recommendation accuracy, and seamless user experience. The scope covers personalized daily rituals including food, drinks, activities, and places to visit based on emotional state and environmental factors.

Major challenge is integrating multiple AI frameworks (Strands, BedrockAgentCore) with external data sources while maintaining conversational context and providing meaningful follow-up interactions. Cost optimization for AI model usage and ensuring reliable fallback mechanisms are also key considerations.

Regarding implementation, the system uses IP-based location detection, fetches real-time weather data, integrates with AWS Bedrock Claude 3.5 Sonnet through Strands framework, and provides both Flask API and Streamlit UI interfaces. The system includes AgentCore deployment capabilities for enterprise integration and maintains conversation history for contextual follow-up interactions.

## Use Case Description

**Primary Use Case**: Conversational AI-Powered Daily Wellness Recommendations

The Daily Ritual AI system provides intelligent, contextual daily ritual recommendations through:
- **Mood-Based Personalization**: Users select or describe their current emotional state
- **Location-Aware Suggestions**: Automatic IP-based location detection with weather integration
- **Conversational Follow-ups**: Users can ask questions and request modifications to recommendations
- **Multi-Modal Interface**: Both API endpoints and interactive Streamlit web interface
- **Enterprise Integration**: AgentCore deployment for business applications

**Target Users**: Health-conscious individuals, wellness enthusiasts, corporate wellness programs, and anyone seeking personalized daily routine guidance.

## Challenges

- **AI Framework Integration**: Coordinating Strands, BedrockAgentCore, and direct AWS Bedrock access
- **Conversational Context**: Maintaining conversation history and providing meaningful follow-up responses
- **API Reliability**: Multiple external API dependencies (OpenWeather, IP geolocation) with fallback mechanisms
- **Cost Management**: AWS Bedrock Claude 3.5 Sonnet usage costs scaling with conversation volume
- **Real-time Performance**: Balancing AI processing time with user experience expectations
- **Enterprise Deployment**: AgentCore integration complexity for business environments

## Success Criterion (Technical)

- Mood detection and interpretation accuracy > 90% for user inputs
- Location detection accuracy > 85% for IP-based geolocation
- Weather data freshness within 1 hour of current conditions
- AI recommendation relevance score > 90% based on contextual appropriateness
- Conversational follow-up response quality maintaining context accuracy
- API response time < 5 seconds for complete recommendation flow including AI processing
- System availability > 99% uptime across all interfaces
- Successful AgentCore deployment and service registration
- Fallback mechanism activation rate < 5% under normal conditions

## Data Description

The system processes and integrates multiple data sources for comprehensive personalization:

**Input Data**:
- User mood selection (predefined options: Happy, Tired, Stressed, Energetic, Sad, Thoughtful, Calm, Motivated)
- Custom mood descriptions (free text input)
- Follow-up questions and modification requests
- User IP address for location detection
- Session conversation history

**External Data Sources**:
- **Weather Data**: Real-time temperature and conditions from OpenWeatherMap API
- **Location Data**: City, country, coordinates from IP geolocation services (ip-api.com, ipapi.co)
- **AI Context**: User preferences and conversation history for contextual responses

**Internal Data Processing**:
- Conversation history management
- Context preservation across interactions
- Mood interpretation and mapping
- Environmental factor integration

**Output Data**:
- Personalized daily ritual recommendations
- Contextual AI-generated suggestions
- Location-specific activity recommendations
- Follow-up responses to user questions
- Conversation history and session state

## Formulated / Implemented Solution

The AI-powered system replaces generic wellness advice with intelligent, contextually-aware daily ritual recommendations. Instead of users researching appropriate activities for their mood and conditions, the system provides instant, personalized suggestions that adapt to their emotional state, local environment, and ongoing conversation context.

This reduces decision fatigue, promotes consistent wellness practices, and provides an interactive experience that evolves with user needs throughout the conversation.
